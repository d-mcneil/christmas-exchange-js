<p>Hey {{to_name}},</p>
<p>
  I wanted to let you know that you got <span style="font-weight: 700; color: green; text-decoration: underline">{{gift_recipient}}</span> for the gift exchange this year, which will take place on
  <span style="font-weight: 700; color: green; text-decoration: underline">Saturday, December 28th</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a link to their <a href="{{wish_list}}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue">Amazon wish list</a>. This list might be empty or not up-to-date until
  <span style="font-weight: 700; color: red">Monday, December 9th</span>, and please make sure to get your own list updated by then as well.
</p>
<p>Also, just a reminder that the budget for the gift is $50.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas,<br />Dean</p>

P.S. - Since this is the first time I'm using email for this, could you shoot me a text to let me know you received this please? Thanks!
